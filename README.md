| Pre-Conditions           | Reuired state before running the test                       |
| Test Steps               | Sequential steps to perform the test                        |
| Test Data                | Data/Inputs needed to execute the test                      |
| Expected Result          | What result are we expected when the system works correctly |
| Actual Result            | The result of the testi                                     |
| Status                   | Pass/Fail/Blocked/Skipped                                   |
| Priority/Severity Level  | Bug Priority & Severity Level                               |
| Created By               | The author information                                      |
| Date                     | Information about when the test created/executed            |
| Remarks/Note             | Additional information (comment/screenshot/references)      |
| Test Type (optional)     | Manual or Automated                                         |

## Types of Test Cases
Test case can be categorized based on what the test is conducted
| Type of Test Cases     | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Functional             | Specific to test the functionality of the system (e.g Search functionality) |
| Non-Functional         | Focused on non-functional (e.g usability, performance, etc)                 |
| UI Test Case           | Validating the UI, responsivesness, design elements                         |
| Positive Test Case     | Use valid data/inputs to ensure the system works as expected                |
| Negative Test Case     | Use invalid data/inputs to check the error handling from the system         |
| Boundary Test Case     | Check max/min limit of an input (e.g Max Character)                         |
| Integration Test Case  | Validate the data flow                                                      |
| Sanity Test Case       | Test to spesific functionality after a change                               |
| Smoke Test Case        | Basic checks to verify the system can work properly after a build           |
| Regression Test Case   | Re-test existing feature after bug fix/change                              ||
